# 2 - 组织

An organization is a collection of people working toward a shared goal. Each organization is an exploration of the possible, undertaken together by the ten, the hundred, or the thousand. Initially, I was tempted to glibly write that sometimes organizations work, but the truly extraordinary thing is that all organizations work.

Some do indeed work better than others, and organizational design is the attempt to understand why some create such energy and others create mostly heat: friction, frustration, and politics. I believe that excellent organizations grow from consistently applying a straightforward process.

When I have a problem that I want to solve quickly and cheaply, I start thinking about process design. A problem I want to solve permanently and we have time to go slow? That’s a good time to evolve your culture. However, if process is too weak a force, and culture too slow, then organizational design lives between those two.

This chapter covers the approaches to organizational design and evolution that I’ve found effective. If you’re reading through and find yourself thinking that this sounds easy, I agree! The hard bit is keeping your courage up when circumstances get challenging.

一个组织是一群朝着共同目标努力的人的集合。每个组织都是一种可能性的探索，由十个人、一百个人或一千个人共同承担。一开始，我很想流畅地说，有时候组织是有用的，但真正了不起的是所有的组织都有用。

有些人确实比其他人做得更好，而组织设计就是试图理解为什么有些人创造了这样的能量，而另一些人则创造了更多的热量:摩擦、挫折和政治。我相信，优秀的组织从持续应用一个简单的过程中成长起来。

当我有一个问题，我想快速和廉价地解决，我开始思考过程设计。一个我想永久解决的问题我们有时间慢慢来吗?这是一个发展你的文化的好时机。然而，如果过程是一种太弱的力量，而文化太慢，那么组织设计就存在于这两者之间。

这一章涵盖了我认为有效的组织设计和发展方法。如果你读了之后觉得这听起来很简单，我同意!困难的部分是当环境变得具有挑战性时保持你的勇气。
